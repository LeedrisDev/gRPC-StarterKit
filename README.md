## gRPC what is it ?

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It uses Protocol 
Buffers, a compact binary serialization format, to define the service interfaces and message payloads. gRPC supports 
a variety of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, and Ruby, among others, making it easy to 
build distributed systems that span multiple platforms and languages. With gRPC, you can define and implement remote 
methods that can be called across the network, just as if they were local function calls, making it a popular choice 
for building microservices architectures. gRPC also provides advanced features such as bidirectional streaming, flow 
control, and automatic retries, making it a robust and scalable choice for building modern distributed systems.
